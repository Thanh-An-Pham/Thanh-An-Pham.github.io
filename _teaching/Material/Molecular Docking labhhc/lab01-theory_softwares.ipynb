Sampling algorithms\n","\n","Most of the currently available molecular docking tools use one or more of the following algorithms to sample the conformations of ligands inside a protein binding pocket ([_Curr Comput Aided Drug Des_ (2011), __7__, 2, 146-157](https://doi.org/10.2174/157340911795677602)).\n","\n","* **Matching algorithms (MA)** compare the shape similarity of ligand conformations and the protein binding pocket, which usually also includes chemical information, e.g. hydrogen bond acceptors and donors. Programs using MA for sampling conformations belong usually to the fastest docking programs. However, these programs require a prior computation of ligand conformations that are used during shape comparison. If the biologically relevant conformation is not present in this library, the algorithm will fail.\n","* In the **incremental instruction** method, the ligand is first deconstructed into smaller fragments by breaking its rotatable bonds. One of the fragments, for example the biggest one, is placed first into the binding pocket. Subsequently, the complete ligand is incrementally constructed inside the binding pocket by connecting the remaining fragments at the appropriate positions of the core fragment. Incremental construction belongs to the fastest class of algorithms but is limited to medium-sized ligands, since an increasing number of fragments can lead to a combinatorial explosion that can extremely slow down the docking calculation.\n","* **Stochastic methods** sample ligand conformations by rigid-body rotation and translation as well as bond rotation.\n","    * **Monte Carlo methods** generate random placements and evaluate obtained conformations inside the protein binding pocket with an energy-based selection criterion. If the pose passes a certain threshold, the conformation is saved and subsequently randomly modified to generate another conformation. This process is performed until a pre-defined number of conformations is reached.\n","    * **Genetic algorithms** are inspired by the natural selection concepts borrowed from Darwin's _Theory of evolution_. Geometric properties of a ligand pose are thereby stored on so-called _chromosomes_, which define the conformation of the ligand. Genetic operations like mutation and cross-over are used to sample the conformational space of the ligand. A scoring function is then used to estimate the quality of the conformations inside the binding pocket. Populations with genetic alterations with the highest scores are finally used for a new generation, which resembles Darwin's concept of the _survival of the fittest_."],"metadata":{"id":"kfKpkkrbCD--"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## 1.3. Scoring functions\n","\n","Scoring functions are used to discriminate correct from incorrect docking poses, i.e., to prioritize active over inactive molecules. They need to be as accurate as possible, and at the same time should require little computing time. Thus, they involve many assumptions and simplifications to reduce computational costs ([_Curr Comput Aided Drug Des_ (2011), __7__, 2, 146-157](https://doi.org/10.2174/157340911795677602), [_Int J Mol Sci_, (2021), __22__, 9, 1-34](https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms22094435), [_J Cheminform_ (2021), __13__, 43, 13-43](https://doi.org/10.1186/s13321-021-00522-2)).\n","\n","* **Force field-based** scoring functions estimate the binding energy by calculating the strength of non-bonded interactions (e.g. van der Waals force, electrostatic interactions) of the protein-ligand complex. Extensions of these methods also include estimates for entropy and desolvation penalties upon ligand binding. A disadvantage of these scoring functions is their comparably high computational cost.\n","* **Empirical** scoring functions are based on coefficients that are used to estimate the contributions of different interaction types, e.g., hydrogen bonds, ionic interactions, hydrophobic contacts. These coefficients were obtained from a regression analysis of protein-ligand complexes with known binding affinity.\n","* **Knowledge-based** scoring functions integrate results from a statistical analysis of experimentally resolved protein-ligand complexes, which gathered information about interatomic contact frequencies and distances observed between protein and ligand. Docking poses will be scored higher if they show contact characteristics that were often observed in the statistical analysis.\n","* **ML/DL-based** scoring functions are machine learning (ML)/deep learning (DL) models that were trained on a set of available protein-ligand complexes with known binding affinity. The protein-ligand complexes are thereby encoded in a computer-readable format, e.g. as interaction fingerprints or graph. Such scoring functions can be applied during post-processing to rank hit compounds more accurately or during the pose evaluation step."],"metadata":{"id":"CqiIPoxzCT6z"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## 1.4. Limitations\n","\n","* Docking programs can consider some residue sidechains flexible during docking calculations to account for binding pocket flexibility. However, the dynamic, adaptive nature of the protein-ligand binding is insufficiently explored by protein-ligand docking. This can result in false positives: Even if the ligand finds a suitable pose in the binding pocket, this position is not guaranteed until the protein is allowed to explore near-minima conformations. Hence, short molecular dynamics simulations are nowadays recommended to evaluate the stability of the predicted pinding pose ([_Curr Comput Aided Drug Des_ (2011), __7__, 2, 146-157](https://doi.org/10.2174/157340911795677602)).  \n","* Scoring functions used by docking programs must be cheap to compute. While the accuracy is good enough to distinguish good poses from bad poses, it can have problems sorting the best poses. For example, while most popular docking programs are able to find the experimental pose in their calculations, this pose is rarely the best one of the proposed set. Furthermore, several retrospective studies have shown that docking scores often poorly correlate with binding affinity ([_J Med Chem_ (2006), __49__, 20, 5912-31](https://doi.org/10.1021/jm050362n), [_Phys Chem Chem Phys_ (2016), __18__, 18, 12964-75](https://doi.org/10.1039/c6cp01555g)).  \n","* To reduce the computational cost, docking procedures are only performed in a subset of the protein (normally around a known binding pocket). Choosing the correct binding site can become another challenge, if the binding pocket is not known a priori.  \n","* To maximize the accuracy of the calculation, the ligand and protein structures must be prepared appropriately. Protonation states of amino acids and the ligands can be tricky to get right, especially in the case of (potential) tautomers. This introduces yet another cause to obtain unfavorable results."],"metadata":{"id":"dlePjfATCiaE"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## 1.5. Visual inspection\n","\n","Due to the afore mentioned limitations of sampling algorithms and docking scoring functions, a visual inspection is commonly performed in most docking scenarios. Interestingly, a survey revealed that molecular modeling experts find docking scores to be the least important criterion for selecting docking poses ([_J Med Chem_ (2021), __64__, 5, 2489–2500](https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jmedchem.0c02227)). Instead, the following criteria are used when selecting docking poses:  \n","\n","* Similarity to binding modes observed in available crystal structures of the protein of interest  \n","* Steric as well as electrostatic and hydrophobic complementary of ligand and protein  \n","  * Unsatisfied hydrogen bond donor and acceptor groups in ligand and protein  \n","  * Solvent exposed hydrophobic ligand moieties  \n","* Interactions with side chains or metal ions critical for protein function, e.g., enzymatic activity\n","* Interaction partners and localization of hydrogen bonds\n","  * Hydrogen bonds formed with the protein backbone in an enclosed hydrophobic protein environment are considered more favorable  \n","  * Hydrogen bonds with charged and solvent exposed protein side chains are considered less favorable  \n","* Displacement of or interactions with water molecules in the binding pocket  \n","* Protein and ligand strain induced by ligand binding  \n","\n","However, also the visual inspection of docking poses has considerable limitations. Of course the success of visual inspection strongly depends on the experience and intuition of the participating scientists. Also, visual inspection can only be performed for a rather small number of molecules considering the available chemical space in virtual screening. Hence, visual inspection is often restricted to the highest scoring molecules of a virtual screening pipeline or only performed for a smaller set of ligands, in which scientists are particularly interested. Finally, also the best expert cannot pick the correct binding pose if it was not sampled by the docking program."],"metadata":{"id":"5Aq9Q839CEGM"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## 1.6.
