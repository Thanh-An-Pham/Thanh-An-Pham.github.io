This is a set of four (4+) tutorials on basic information of deep learning in drug discovery incoporating tensorflow and pytorch framework, using the **Google Colab** free cloud-computing environment in **Spring 2023**.


## Introduction

These tutorials were created between Jan-April 2023 as part of the **MedAI Training Session 2** for full execution over Google Colab and remote accesibility via web browsers.

Each tutorial includes a brief introduction of the activities to be performed, installation instructions of the open-source software to be used in each session and several programming, visualization and data analysis activities to be achieved during the tutorial. 

After this training session, you will know:
- Build a feed forward neural network using tensorflow and pytorch framework
- Validate the model performance using validation data set
- Visualize loss plot
- Optimize model by changing nodes, layers, dropout, regularization,...
- Early stopping technique
- Save and load model
- Basic understanding of transfer learning

## Description of the Tutorials

The following is a brief description of each tutorial, along with the open-source software used for each task:
