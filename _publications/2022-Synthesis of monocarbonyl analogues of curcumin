**Summary**:
Synthesis of 24 assymetric Monocarbonyl Analogues of Curcumin (MACs) which containing 1-(4-nitrophenyl)-1H-pyrazole and 1,3-diphenyl-1H-pyrazole heterocyclics was executed in terms of evaluating their biological activities. This process integrates intermediates A (1H-pyrazole-4-carbaldehyde derivatives) and intermediates B (4-phenylbut-3-en-2-one derivatives) through aldolisation reaction in particular condition. These compounds were structurally identified by melting point, thin layer chromatography, IR, MS, 1H-NMR and 13C-NMR. 
**Keywords**: curcumin, MACs, 1H-pyrazole, aldol condensation.
