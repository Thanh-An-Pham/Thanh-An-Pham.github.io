# Abstract
Updating...

## Workflow
The project contains four parts:
- Pharmacophore modeling: automated results extraction and comparasion; ensemble learning to enhance performance
- QSAR (Classification and regression tasks): develop full data pipeline and statistical test
- Molecular docking: using five docking softwares to perform retrospective control

## Requirements

This module requires the following modules:

- [RDkit](https://www.rdkit.org/)
- [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
